This graph visualizes the trend of transportation price increases throughout the year 2023 in Canada. As shown in the plot, there are fluctuations in transportation costs, with the most significant rise occurring in December. Notable months such as April, June, and August also show a substantial increase compared to the earlier months of the year.

Key Observations:
January to March: Transportation costs remained relatively stable, showing only a minor increase.
April: A noticeable spike in prices occurred, possibly due to the transition from winter to spring and increased demand for transportation.
Mid-year fluctuations: While May and June showed price increases, there was some stabilization in July and August, with another small peak in August.
December surge: The most significant increase occurred in December, potentially due to holiday season demand and the impacts of winter weather conditions.
This data is essential for understanding how transportation costs vary throughout the year, which could be valuable for forecasting future trends, budgeting for businesses, or informing policymakers about price stability.
